    <ul class="glossary">
        <li><b>Astrometry:</b> The measurement of the positions, motions, and magnitudes of stars</li>
        <li><b>Astronomical Unit (AU):</b> A unit of measurement used to describe the distance between a planet and its host star (1 AU ~ 93 million miles ~ 150 million kilometers)</li>
        <li><b>Declination:</b> The angular distance that measures the north-south distance. Expressed in degrees, it is the celestial sphere's equivalent of latitude ('+' refers to North, '-' refers to South)</li>
        <li><b>Disk Kinematics:</b> The observational study or measurement of the kinematics or motions of stars through space</li>
        <li><b>Eccentricity:</b> A measure of how circular an orbit is (0: perfect circle, 0 &lt e &lt  1: elliptical, e > 1: hyperbolic)</li>
        <li><b>Eclipse Timing Variations:</b> A method used to detect exoplanets in binary star systems by analyzing the timing of eclipses caused by one star passing in front of the other</li>
        <li><b>Equilibrium Temperature:</b> The temperature a planet would achieve if it were perfectly absorbing all incoming solar radiation and perfectly emitting outgoing radiation, with no net heat gain or loss</li>
        <li><b>Exoplanet:</b> A planet that orbits a star other than our Sun</li>
        <li><b>Giga-Year (Gyr):</b> A unit of time to describe ages of stars and planets equal to one billion years</li>
        <li><b>Imaging:</b> A method of discovering exoplanets that involves directly observing the light reflected or emitted by an exoplanet, allowing astronomers to create images and study their properties</li>
        <li><b>Insolation:</b> The amount of incoming stellar radiation that a planet receives from its star. A crucial factor in determining the planet's climate and potential habitability. </li>
        <li><b>Kelvin:</b> The base unit for temperature in the International System of Units (SI). To convert Kevin to Celsius, subtract by 273.15.</li>
        <li><b>Microlensing:</b> A method for discovering exoplanets by observing how the gravity of a planet and its host star bends and magnifies the light from a distant background star</li>
        <li><b>Morgan-Keenan System:</b> A method for classifying stars based on their spectral characteristics and luminosity. Stars are categorized into spectral classes (O, B, A, F, G, K, M), with O being the hottest and M being the coolest</li>
        <li><b>Neutron Star:</b> Stars with cores that such powerful gravity that most positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons in their interiors combine into uncharged neutrons</li>
        <li><b>Orbital Brightness Modulation:</b> A method of discovering exoplanet by finding changes in a star's brightness caused by a planet's orbit, either through the planet's reflection of starlight or due to distortions in the star's shape</li>
        <li><b>Parsecs:</b> A unit for expressing large astronomical distance (1 parsecs ~ 206264 AU)</li>
        <li><b>Pulsar:</b> A rapidly rotating neutron star that emits beams of radiation. They are incredibly dense remnants of massive stars that have exploded as supernovas</li>
        <li><b>Pulsar Timing:</b> A technique used to detect exoplanets by observing how they gravitationally deviates the timing of a pulsar's pulses</li>
        <li><b>Pulsation Timing Variations:</b> An exoplanet detection method that analyzes the subtle changes in the timing of a star's pulsations to infer the presence of an orbiting companion, such as a planet or a binary star</li>
        <li><b>Radial Velocity:</b> The speed at which an object is moving towards or away from the observer</li>
        <li><b>Right Ascension:</b> The angular distance that measures the east-west distance. Measured in degrees, it is the celestial equivalent of longitude.</li>
        <li><b>Stellar Age:</b> The age of the host star measured in Giga-Year</li>
        <li><b>Stellar Radius:</b> The length of a line segment from the center of the star to its surface, measured in units of radius of the Sun</li>
        <li><b>Stellar Temperature:</b> Temperature of the star as modeled by a black body emitting the same total amount of electromagnetic radiation. Typically measured in Kelvin</li>
        <li><b>Stellar Type:</b> Classification of the star based on their spectral characteristics following the Morgan-Keenan system</li>
        <li><b>Supernovas:</b> A catastrophic explosion of a star, resulting in an extremely bright burst of light and energy</li>
        <li><b>Transit:</b> An exoplanet detection method that involves observing a star's brightness over time, looking for periodic dips that indicate a planet transiting (passing in front of) its host star</li>
        <li><b>Transit Timing Variations:</b> A method of exoplanet discovery that relies on detecting subtle variations in the timing of a planet's transit across its host star</li>
